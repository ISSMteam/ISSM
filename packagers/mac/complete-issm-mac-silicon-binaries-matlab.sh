# Wrapper script to build, package, send for signing, and transfer to ISSM 
# website ISSM distributable package with MATLAB API for macOS running on 
# Silicon.
#
# Normally, we would put this directly into the project configuration under 
# 'Build' -> 'Execute shell', but because it is a bit more involved, it is a 
# good idea to version it.
#
# When no failures/errors occur, performs the following:
# - Builds ISSM according to configuration.
# - Packages executables and libraries.
# - Runs test suite against package.
# - Commits compressed package to repository to be signed by JPL Cybersecurity.
# - Retrieves signed package and transmits it to ISSM Web site for 
#	distribution.
#
# Options:
# -b/--skipbuild		Skip ISSM compilation.
# -r/--resign			Skip ISSM compilation and packaging. Use to retrigger 
#						signing/notarization if it fails but build and package 
#						are valid.
# -s/--skiptests		Skip ISSM compilation and testing during packaging 
#						step. Use if packaging fails for some reason but build 
#						is valid.
# -t/--transferonly		Transfer package to ISSM Web site only. Use if transfer 
#						fails for some reason to skip building, packaging, and 
#						signing.
# -u/--unlock			Remove lock file from signed package repository. Use if 
#						build is aborted to allow for subsequent fresh build.
#
# Debugging:
# - Relies on a very tight handshake with project on remote JPL Cybersecurity 
#	Jenkins server. Debugging may be performed locally by running,
#
#		packagers/mac/sign-issm-mac-binaries.sh
#
#	with "AD_IDENTITY", "AD_USERNAME", and "ASC_PROVIDER" hardcoded to Apple 
#	Developer credentials (make sure to also set keychain password in 
#	"ALTOOL_PASSWORD") and "PKG" and "VARIANT_REPO_SUBPATH" properly set for 
#	the package signing to be tested (should match constants "PKG" and 
#	"REPO_BASE_URL" defined in this script).
# - Removing stdout/stderr redirections to null device (> /dev/null 2>&1) can 
#	help debug potential SVN issues.
#
# NOTE:
# - Use only *one* of the above options at a time, and make sure it is removed 
#	again after a single run.
# - Builds will fail when any of the above options are used on a clean 
#	workspace. For example, if 'Source Code Management' -> 'Check-out Strategy' 
#	select menu is set to "Always check out a fresh copy".
# - Assumes that "ISSM_BINARIES_USER" and "ISSM_BINARIES_PASS" are set up in 
#	the 'Bindings' section under a 'Username and password (separated)' binding 
#	(requires 'Credentials Binding Plugin') with 'Credentials' select menu set 
#	to "jenkins/****** (SVN repository for ISSM binaries)".
#
# TODO:
# - Generalize these wrapper scripts even further by defining only constants in 
# config file (the rest of the script is identical).
